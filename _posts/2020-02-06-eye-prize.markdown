# **Concept**

How peopleâ€™s attention is sold for companies to promote ads on their screen. Here is a sugarcoated warning for you, just as those ads that are trying to gain your attention for as long as they can.

# Demo

<!-- can use the html in md -->
<div class="iframe-container">
<iframe  class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUus6p_hP_Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

# Lessons Learned

## Difference between visibility and display
 When I was creating the buttons for the bottom div, I used **visibility: hidden** and **visibility: visible** to toggle between each selection of buttons. However, the problem with that is I can not select the other divs since the hidden div is still on top of another. Therefore, I should use **display: flex** and **display: none** to solve that problem.

## Move within boundary

Another process is I wanted the pupil to be draggable within the range of eyeBorder. 
I was introduced the function:
```
    getBoundingClientRect();
```
It creates the boundary of the element in the shape of a rectangle. I tried it using left, top, right, and bottom. However, it works on three sides, meaning that I can see the eye is stopped by the same border as the eyeBorder. However, there is something wrong with the right side, I always go over the border.

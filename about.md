Hi, Yiting here!

![../assets/profile_square.jpg](../assets/profile_square.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I am a creative technologist designing experiences to foster meaningful interactions through AR/VR, music, and performance.

I am currently developing skills in creative coding, physical computing, and fabrication in NYU ITP. I have experience in graphic design, marketing, and post-production. So I have been utilizing these skills to conduct research, tell engaging stories, and create intriguing visual representations throughout my projects.
